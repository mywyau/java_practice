2. Spring Boot Fundamentals
   - Understanding the Spring Boot project structure
   - Spring Boot Annotations (@RestController, @Service, @Repository, etc.)
   - Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (IoC)
   - Application Properties and Configuration

3. Building a REST API
   - Creating RESTful endpoints with Spring Boot
   - Handling HTTP requests and responses
   - Using @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and @DeleteMapping
   - Exception handling with @ControllerAdvice

4. Database Integration
   - Connecting Spring Boot to a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or H2)
   - Using Spring Data JPA with Hibernate
   - Writing CRUD operations with JpaRepository
   - Database migrations with Flyway or Liquibase

5. Advanced Spring Boot Features

   - Logging and Monitoring
   - Spring Boot Testing (Unit & Integration Testing)

6. Microservices and Deployment
   - Building Microservices with Spring Boot
   - Communicating between microservices (REST, Kafka)
   - Deploying Spring Boot apps (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS)
